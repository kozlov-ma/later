# later

A simple CLI TODO-app with focus on small tasks 

### Usage
Ideally, each task should take no more than two minutes to finish. For that exact purpose you can only remove all the tasks at once using `later --clear`. Adding a task is as simple as writing `later "task"`. To view the list of all tasks, use `later`.

### Compatibility
`later` should be compatible with macOS (tested), Linux and Windows.
